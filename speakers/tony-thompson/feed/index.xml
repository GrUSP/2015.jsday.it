				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re writing software, somebody somewhere has to deploy it. How do you make sure your developer preferences don&#8217;t impact your production environment? And how do you make sure that your production environment doesn&#8217;t impose a set of tools on your developers?This talk will explore how a DevOps team can support a Dev team &#8212; and what a Dev team should ask for from DevOps. Both sides of the shop need to understand what they are delivering at an early stage in development, and what they each can provide to each other in order to make implementation easier. This talk will provide a starting point to have that discussion.From a practical perspective, we&#8217;ll go over how we use Vagrant in development at bitHound: How we keep our environments in sync, and the strategies we&#8217;ve developed to reduce friction using these tools on a day to day basis.</p>
