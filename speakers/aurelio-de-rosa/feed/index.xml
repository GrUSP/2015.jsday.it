				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As web developers, our job is to build nice, fast, and reliable websites, web apps, or web services. But our role isn&#8217;t limited to this. We have to build these products not only for our ideal users but for a range of people as wide as possible. Today&#8217;s browsers help us in achieving this goal providing APIs created with this scope in mind. One of these APIs is the Web Speech API that provides speech input and text-to-speech output features in a web browser.In this talk you&#8217;ll learn what the Web Speech API is and how it can drastically improve the way users, especially those with disabilities, perform tasks in your web pages.</p>
