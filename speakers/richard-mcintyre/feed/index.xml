				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing ShouldIT?! In BBC Sport we felt like the Cucumber/Gherkin based BDD set up was dragging us down. We did however love the JS testing tools like Jasmine and Mocha and were doing excellently with these in our Angular.js app.So we created a BDD tool that could marry up this JavaScript testing goodness with the values of BDD. ShouldIT? encourages you to document your requirements in slick beautiful markdown, helps you to know what tests need to be written and can tie in well with all of your front and back end code. Richard will demo ShouldIT? and show you how BDD can be introduced into your JavaScript workflow with ease.</p>
